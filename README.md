**Real-time Aircraft Tracking & Data Enrichment System**

FlightSpy is a sophisticated aircraft monitoring solution that combines ADSB receiver data with commercial flight information. The system polls a Dump1090 instance, enriches aircraft data with [ADSBDB](https://www.adsbdb.com/) API, and provides persistent storage with analytics capabilities.

## üöÄ Quick StartHaifa Wholesale LLC

### Prerequisites
1. **Hardware & Data Source**:
   - ADSB receiver feeding data to [Dump1090](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090).
2. **Software Requirements**:
   - [![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-27.3.1-blue.svg)](https://podman.io/docs/installation) Engine installed and running.
   - ```pip3 install podman-compose```  For container orchestration

---

### Installation
1. Clone repository:
 ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flightspy.git
   cd flightspy
```

2. Create environment file:
.env file in the project root directory

3. Add Cridentials to .env file.
```
POSTGRES_DB=flightspy
POSTGRES_USER=flightspy_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret_password
POSTGRES_HOST=db
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```
4. Windows machines may need to apply this fix to get podman-compose working.
```
C:\Users\User\Documents\GitHub\FlightSpy\.venv\Lib\site-packages\podman_compose.py
Comment out this line:
# loop.add_signal_handler(signal.SIGINT, lambda: [t.cancel("User exit") for t in tasks])
```

5. Start services from root directory
```
podman-compose up --build -d
```

### üîß System Architecture

FlightSpy is built on a robust and scalable architecture designed to process, enrich, and store real-time aircraft data. Here's how it works:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - An **ADSB receiver** captures raw aircraft signals (e.g., position, altitude, speed) from nearby aircraft.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - The raw data is sent to a **computer** running [Dump1090](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090), which decodes and transforms the ADSB signals into a readable format (e.g., JSON).

3. **Data Polling**:
   - **FlightSpy** periodically polls the Dump1090 server to retrieve the latest aircraft data.

4. **Data Enrichment**:
   - FlightSpy uses the [ADSBDB API](https://www.adsbdb.com/) to enrich the Dump1090 data with additional details, such as aircraft type, registration, airline, and flight route.

5. **Caching**:
   - To optimize performance and reduce API calls to ADSBDB, **Redis** is used as a caching layer. This ensures frequently requested data is served quickly without overloading external APIs.

6. **Data Storage**:
   - All enriched data is stored in a **PostgreSQL** database for persistent storage, enabling historical analysis and querying.

7. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Planned updates include a **live map interface** that will display aircraft locations, flight paths, and detailed information in real-time, providing an interactive and visually engaging experience.
